description: The origin story of the Lone Wolf, master criminal with a conscienceOne
  rainy winter night, an orphan is abandoned to the care of a shabby Parisian inn
  called Troyon's. For the next eleven years, the boy is up before dawn to clean and
  fetch and serve, his only respite the closet to which he retires at night and the
  books he pilfers from the hotel's guests. A few francs here and there also find
  their way into his pockets, but not so much that anyone would notice-anyone, that
  is, except Bourke, the cultivated Irish thief who regularly hides out at Troyon's.
  Caught red-handed, the amateur outwits.
